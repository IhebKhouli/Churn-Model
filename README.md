# SAS Churn Model for Ooredoo

## Overview

This repository contains a powerful SAS churn model designed to predict customer churn within the telecommunications industry, with a specific focus on Ooredoo. Customer churn is a critical concern for telecom companies, and this model is created to help Ooredoo better understand and proactively address this challenge.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** The model utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and indicators of potential customer churn. It considers a variety of data sources, including customer demographics, usage patterns, service history, and more.

- **Machine Learning:** The heart of this model is a logistic regression model that can effectively predict churn based on historical data.

- **Data Preprocessing:** I've integrated data preprocessing and feature engineering steps to ensure the highest data quality and model accuracy.

- **Evaluation Framework:** The model is equipped with a robust evaluation framework, enabling us to assess its performance, fine-tune its parameters, and continually improve its accuracy.

## Usage

This SAS churn model is designed to support Ooredoo's data science and customer retention teams. By analyzing customer data and predicting churn, it allows us to develop proactive customer engagement and retention initiatives.

- Use the model to identify customer segments at the highest risk of churning.
- Tailor retention strategies to address specific customer needs.
- Continually monitor the model's performance and adjust strategies as needed.
